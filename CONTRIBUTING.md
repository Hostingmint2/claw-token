## Contributing to Claw Token

Thank you for contributing — we want to make adoption and integration frictionless.

- Bug reports: open an issue with the `bug` template and include reproduction steps and logs.
- Feature requests: open a feature request and tag it with `proposal` and `priority`.
- Pull requests: branch from `main`, add tests or smoke scripts, include a short description and link to the adoption checklist.

Developer checklist for PRs:
- Run `npm test` / `npm run check-security` locally
- Add or update smoke/integration script if behavior changes
- Update `README.md` and `SECURE_DEPLOY.md` for operational changes

Maintainers will triage PRs and issues within 48 hours; for urgent security fixes, add `SECURITY` to the PR title.
